৹ Gravitation is the weakest force                                                                                                                    Questions
                                                                                                                                    Gravitational force is responcible for planets to orbit around the sun

GRAVITATION
           The force of attraction between two
 bodies is directly proportional to their masses, and
 propotional to the square of separation between them
 
৹ Gravitation is a LONG RANGE FORCE

৹ (capital) G --> Universal Gravitational Constant

৹ Universal Law Of Gravitation 

৹ G = 6.67 x 10‾¹¹ Nm²/kg²

৹ 4 fundamental force

৹ Gravitation exists everywhere in the universe

৹ Gravitation force is LONG RANGE FORCE

৹ Strong Nuclear Force

৹ F = G m1 m2/ r²

৹ F ∝ m1 m2/r²

৹ S.I unite of  G = N-m²/kg²

৹ To find S.I unit of G = Fr²/m1m2

৹ G does not depend on 
          ৹ Nature of the interacting bodies
          ৹ Size of the interacting bodies
          ৹ Mass of the interacting bodies

৹ (small) g = Acceleration due to gravity

           ৹ The unique acceleration which is gained by the
 object because of gravitational force , is called acceleration due to gravity

৹ g = GM/R²
          ৹ G --> Universal Gravitational Constant
          ৹ M --> Mass of earth
          ৹ R --> Radius of earth

৹R = 6.4 x 10⁶

৹ Acceleration due to gravity  ---> does not depend on mass of earth 

৹ Acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m/s²

৹ gm = ge/6

৹ At Poles of the earth acceleration = 10 m/s²

৹ At equator of the earth = 9.8 m/s²

৹ g ∝ 1/r²

৹ The Acceleration Due To Gravity ---> Varies with the height and depth on the earth

৹ S.I unit of g = m/sec²

৹ Acceleration due to gravity DECREASES with height from the earth surface

৹Acceleration due to gravity DECREASES with depth from the earth surface

৹ Acceleration due to gravity is maximum at ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH

৹ The value of 'g' at the centre of the earth is 0 M/SEC²
